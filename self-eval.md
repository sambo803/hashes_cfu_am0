# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
  Ans.: I struggled with some of the problems. I understood the
  concepts, just had trouble getting a feel for the variations
  and different syntax presented.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
  Ans.: Note taking is going okay, using one notebook for this mod,
  wondering what I may need for Mod1. I think I'll need a bigger
  notebook. I'd like to have just one for each Mod, to have a nice
  reference.

- Wha do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
   Ams.: I try to solve it myself first. I like to see the material, having
   read it first. Then having it presented in class. Then going out
   when not finding answers readily available. I think this is a
   generational thing, partly. For instance, my kids use YouTube videos
   for learning, i'm getting there too! But I would say they've really
   grown up with the feeling of the knowledge being right there. *have to adapt, as the internet and web apps available give such amazing power
   to the speed and even the depth of learning readily available, but you
   need to strive to be engaged with the technology. A good book is still hard to beat though! But... Not when needing to learn something quickly!
